## Comparison with OSNet

[OSNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Zhou_Omni-Scale_Feature_Learning_for_Person_Re-Identification_ICCV_2019_paper.html) is a useful lightweight CNN baseline for evaluating the accuracy/efficiency trade-off of PersonViT. A practical comparison should include OSNet x1.0, PersonViT-S/16, and PersonViT-B/16. For deployment without target-domain adaptation, [OSNet-AIN x1.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06827) is also relevant because it was designed for improved cross-domain generalization.

| Model | Parameters | GFLOPs at 256 x 128 | Embedding dimension | Typical use |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| OSNet x1.0 | 2.2M | 0.98 | 512 | Edge or real-time deployment |
| PersonViT-S/16 | 22.0M | 2.94 | 384 | Balanced accuracy and inference cost |
| PersonViT-B/16 | 86.5M | 11.35 | 768 | Accuracy-oriented GPU deployment |

The OSNet complexity values are from the [official Torchreid model zoo](https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/deep-person-reid/MODEL_ZOO.html). The PersonViT values are calculated from the models in this repository with a 256 x 128 input and a 16 x 16 stride. Runtime latency can differ from FLOPs and must be measured with the target hardware and inference backend.

The following published checkpoint results are shown as **Rank-1 / mAP** and are useful as an off-the-shelf reference:

| Model | Market1501 | DukeMTMC-reID | MSMT17 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| OSNet x1.0 | 94.2 / 82.6 | 87.0 / 70.2 | 74.9 / 43.8 |
| PersonViT-S/16 | 96.8 / 92.9 | 91.9 / 84.7 | 88.8 / 74.3 |
| PersonViT-B/16 | 97.6 / 95.0 | 93.8 / 88.1 | 92.0 / 80.8 |

OSNet results are from the [official model zoo](https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/deep-person-reid/MODEL_ZOO.html), and PersonViT results are from the [released fine-tuning logs](https://huggingface.co/lakeAGI/PersonViTReID). These numbers are **not a controlled architecture-only comparison**: the released models use different pre-training, loss functions, optimizers, data augmentation, and evaluation details. In particular, the OSNet model-zoo baseline uses softmax loss, while PersonViT uses softmax and triplet losses.

For a fair deployment comparison:

1. Use exactly the same person detections, crops, query/gallery split, and 256 x 128 input resolution.
2. Keep each model's expected pixel normalization; OSNet uses ImageNet normalization, while the released PersonViT configuration uses mean and standard deviation `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`.
3. L2-normalize both embeddings, use the same distance metric, and disable re-ranking.
4. Measure mAP, Rank-1, false-accept and false-reject rates, batch-1 p50/p95 latency, throughput, peak memory, and model size.
5. Use the same hardware, precision (FP32 or FP16), runtime, batch size, and warm-up procedure.
6. Report results separately for operational conditions such as occlusion, low resolution, nighttime, and individual cameras.

As a starting point, prefer OSNet x1.0 when latency and memory are the primary constraints, PersonViT-S/16 when a moderate compute budget is available, and PersonViT-B/16 when retrieval accuracy is the priority. The final choice should be based on validation data collected from the actual deployment environment.
