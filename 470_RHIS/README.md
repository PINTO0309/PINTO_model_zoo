# 470_RHIS

A lightweight ROI-based hierarchical instance segmentation model for human detection with knowledge distillation from EfficientNet-based teacher models. The model achieves efficient real-time performance through a two-stage hierarchical architecture and temperature progression distillation techniques.

Detectron/Detectron2, YOLO not used. However, you can always merge this with your favorite object detection model such as YOLO, DEIM, or RT-DETR to have an end-to-end instance segmentation model.
